//   1. Accept a three digit number from the user (100 to 999). First, check that the number has only three digits. Then separate each digit of the number and then arrange them in the reverse order such that the middle digit remains the same and first and third digit are swapped.
//    Example -
//    Input: 347
//    Output: 743
//   2. Write a program to accept an array of integers from the user. After accepting the input, arrange the elements in such a way that the largest element is at the last index and the smallest is at the 0th index. The first line of input will denote the number of elements in the array followed by the elements. Finally, output the re-arranged array in ascending order.
//            Example -
//    Input: 5
//            64 1 32 978 12
//    Output: 1 12 32 64 978
//   3. Accept an array from a user, duplicate it by creating a similar array and then try to compare it by equating both arrays (using the == operator). The result will be false as the duplicate arrays won't be equal to each other. Try to find the reason behind it and also make the same by using a different function (you might need the help of the internet for this).
//   4. Play a little prank with your friends and swap their names in the attendance website. Use Java to code a program to perform this. Keep in mind that you do not have any additional space for more variables. Use just two.
//            Example -
//    Input: a = "Harry", b = "Drake"
//    Output: a = "Drake", b = "Harry"
//   5. Let's create a basic calculator using Java. The calculator will have the following functions:
//    Addition
//            Subtraction
//    Multiplication
//            Division
//    Remainder
//
//    Make sure that while performing division the denominator is not zero. And if any user inputs zero, appropriate message should be displayed instead of a break in execution. First ask the user to input the two operands and then output the results of all the functions separately.
//            Example -
//    Input: a = 23, b = 12
//    Output: Add = 35
//    Sub = 11
//    Mul = 264
//    Div = 1
//
//    Example -
//    Input: a = 23, b = 0
//    Output: Add = 23
//    Sub = 23
//    Mul = 0
//    Div = Divide by 0 is not allowed
